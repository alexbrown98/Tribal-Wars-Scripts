# Tribal Wars Scripts
 A collection of scripts for the online game Tribal Wars written by me in Python to give me an edge in certain aspects of the game.

The scripts use selenium to recognize game elements and uses pyautogui to perform mouse and keyboard actions.

The scripts include:
- Attack script: Used for sending attacks accurate to the nearest millisecond
- Premium Script: Plays a sound when the prices of the market for resources reach a certain point
- Scavenge Script: Used to automate the sending of scavenge missions for any number of villages and any numer of troops. Works indefinately until stopped.
